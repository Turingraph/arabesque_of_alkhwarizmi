This folder is for defining concrete geometrical objects e.g. cube, tiling, vector etc. It contains 4 sub folders
1.  `obj_alphabet/`
-   Contains: Latin alphabet and Hindu Arabic number defined by `obj_basis/` e.g. a, b, ..., z, 0, ..., 8 and 9.
-   Status  : This folder is not developed in MVP.
2.  `obj_basis/`
-   Contains: The basic geometrical components e.g. vector, hyperplain, line etc.

3.  `obj_polytope/`
-   Contains: polytopes defined by `obj_basis/` e.g. platonic solids, archimedean solid etc and group of polytopes that form tessellation e.g. square tiling etc.
