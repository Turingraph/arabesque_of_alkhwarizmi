This folder is for defining concrete geometrical objects e.g. cube, tiling, vector etc. It contains 4 sub folders
1.  `basis/`
-   Contains: The basic geometrical components e.g. vector, hyperplain, line etc.
-   Status  : This folder is developed in MVP.
2.  `fractal/`
-   Contains: Fractal based on `basis/`
-   Status  : This folder is not developed in MVP.
3.  `polytope/`
-   Contains: polytopes defined by `basis/` e.g. platonic solids, archimedean solid etc and group of polytopes that form tessellation e.g. square tiling etc.
-   Status  : This folder is developed in MVP.
4.  `smooth/`
-   Contains: famous smooth manifold e.g. sphere, torus, mobius strip and klein bottle.
