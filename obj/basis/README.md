The purpose of this folder is to define basic objects including
1.  `bezier.py` (bezier curve for approximating smooth manifold)
2.  `hyperplain.py`
3.  `line.py` (straight line)
4.  `long_line.py` (long straight line)
5.  `polytope.py`
6.  `tiling.py`
7.  `vector.py`

Note that 
1.  every objects in this folder are created by `vector.py`
2.  `bezier.py` is the only Python file in this folder that is not developed in MVP.
