The purpose of this folder is to compute linear algebra related algorithms and assigned the color based on the user customized visualization.

This folder have 4 files
1.  `cross_product_3d.py`
-   Purpose : Compute and visualizing cross product in 3D Vector Space over Real.
2.  `linear_equation.py`
-   Purpose : Compute the solution of basic linear equation and other properties of matrix
    1.  Gaussian Elimination
    2.  Null space
    3.  Transpose
    4.  Inverse Matrix
    5.  Determinant
    6.  Eigan Value
    7.  Eigan Vector
3.  `operation.py`
-   Purpose : Compute and visualize 4 basic matrix-vector operations
    1.  Addition of Numpy array
    2.  Dot product
    3.  Matrix and scalar multiplication
    4.  Matrix power
4.  `vector.py`
-   Purpose : Compute and visualize properties of vectors.
    1.  Length of vector
    2.  Angle between 2 vectors
    3.  Vector projection to another vector

Note that "visualize" in this case means to return the valid color highlight the geometric object based on user defined color and other property of transformed vector and/or matrix e.g. Determinant, length of vector etc.
