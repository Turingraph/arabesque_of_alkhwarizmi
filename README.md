# Description

`arabesque_of_alkhwarizmi` is Numpy-Manim based Python library that is used for visualizing 2D and 3D representation of linear algebra related concept and user defined dataset. This tools help user learn interesting mathematical concept e.g. Linear Algebra, Group Theory, Lie Algebra, Topology etc, gain visual intuition of high dimensional geometry and generating cool looking visual art.

# Inspiration

Before I started to learn to code for the first time in 2021, I used to like drawing, especially by draw multiple straight lines and grids 
as the basis of my artwork such that I can draw symmetrical pattern and/or 3D perspective art. The 3Blue1Brown's Linear Algebra visualization (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) also reminds me of how I drew my artworks. 
However in my opinion, visual art is boring because many artists try to create new artworks when the visual art is limited in 5D rgbxy Euclidean Space where there is rarely anythings new to be created.

One of multiple ways to creating new interesting artworks is to create the 2D representation of higher dimensional objects.

High dimensional geometry also have very interesting unexpected properties such as
1.  There are 6 Platonic solids in 4D Euclidean Space.

2.  4D Object can have 2 independent axis where the object is rotated at the same time.

3.  Cross product only exists in 3D and 7D Vector Space
-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Generalizations
4.  The Quaternions Ring is the 4D Vector Space that can be used for describe rotation of 3D Object.

5.  Hypersphere have weird property

6.  etc.

I also have graphite color synesthesia and I want to know what color do the 2D representations of higher dimensional version of alphabet and number it feel for me.
